            <p>Tried Buttermilk & Bourbon difficult to reserve for weekend brunch. Overall, the food
                was good, depending on the dish. However, a bit overpriced for what you're getting
                where most dished are Tapas-sized to medium sized portions. The warm honey glazed
                biscuits were very good and flavorful. Fried chicken sliders were not dry on the inside,
                flavorful, and crunchy. Overall, the atmosphere is nice, and waiters were prompt in
                bringing out all of our orders.</p>
