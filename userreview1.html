            <p>This place didn't live up to my expectations. Almost every pot except for the veggie pot
                has shellfish; I am disappointed I couldn't do a substitution for another item on the menu
                as I am allergic to shellfish. Another member of my party didn't like some things that
                came with the pots, so he chose the beef hot soup and picked out what he liked with Thai
                soup as the base (the only substitution he could make). His pot looked half empty and
                was still charged the full price of the beef hot soup since substitutions aren't allowed. The
                rest of my party agreed there seems to be more filler stuff in the pot like cabbage etc and
                barely any meat. Though, the soup base was flavorful, and the bubble tea was good, that
                was about it. I think Tasty Pot should work on allowing substitutions to make the pots a
                little more customizable and accommodate those with food allergies and picky eaters. I
                won't be coming back here again, save your money for AYCE.</p>
