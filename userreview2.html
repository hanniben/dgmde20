            Rating: 1/4 stars<br>
            <p>The food here is mediocre for the price of $41 and the long wait. The buffet shouldn't be
                advertised as Las Vegas style, you'll be disappointed and find out it is far from Las Vegas
                style. The buffet was very small. The steaks were unseasoned and tasted too irony for me.
                Crab legs were dry and the rest of the food was meh. The best part of the buffet were the
                desserts, creme brulee was the best. Avoid the ice cream; the ice cream wheel looked
                cool but tasted too icy and watered down. Save your money and eat at other better buffets
                around the area.</p>
